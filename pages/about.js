            Having previously worked in retail, telemarketing and customer
            service, after completing my Literature MSc during the Covid-19
            lockdowns, I decided to expand my horizons and try something new. I
            wanted to be able to work creatively and productively while engaging
            fresh opportunities for learning and personal growth. I knew that
            programming would allow me to do just that.

            certifications in Spring 2022. This led me to the School of Code,
            where I was selected as one of 150 bootcampers – out of nearly 3000
            applicants – to train full-time from April through August in
            software development.
