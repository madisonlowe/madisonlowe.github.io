We've continued work on the app and API since, accomplishing more stretch goals. A video of our presentation is linked in the GitHub repository.",

Our team won! It was great to get some experience using Couchbase and non-relational databases, which I had never used before this hackathon, and I loved getting to know the Couchbase team and engineers. A really fun experience!",
